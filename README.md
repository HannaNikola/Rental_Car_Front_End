# Rental_Car_Front_End

This project is the frontend for a car rental application.

On the catalog page of this application, you can see all available campers. By 

clicking the "show more" button, a modal window opens with detailed information 

about the camper, including information about the camper's features and 

reviews, as well as a form for booking the camper.

When clicking the "heart" button on an ad card, it should be added to the list 

of favorites. To work with the list of ads, create your personal backend for 

development using a UI service mockAPI.
